Uses an arduino uno with thermosensor and array of 5 lights to show relative temp of a space.
Also prints temperatures in the serial monitor in degrees Celsius.

Light array runs cold to hot in the following order:
- Purple
- Blue
- White - target/anticipated normal temp
- Orange
- Red

Possible future changes:
- add led temp display
- modify for sounds to measure and display relative noise levels
